            <strong>
                In my professional experience, I've worked optimizing databases and developing Power BI reports, generating dashboards that improve operational management through <br><br>
                critical metrics such as response times and incidents. I also implemented machine learning models that automated the classification of technical incidents, reducing processing times by 80%.<br><br>

                I excel in tools such as Python, SQL, Power BI, and Google Cloud Platform, and I also hold certifications in databases and data analysis with Python. I am currently strengthening <br><br>
                my skills in visualization and analysis with Power BI and developing my passion for transforming data into key information for strategic decision-making.<br><br>
